- [x] integration tests - db resets
- [x] .http files for testing
- [x] authentication/authorization

- [x] Data/UserDto - remove
- [x] fix swagger

### Eventually
- ~~[ ] integration tests - coverage for all business cases~~ - not necessary, only examples added 
- [ ] client - vue
- [ ] logging
- [x] appsettings for local development/hosted
- [ ] unit tests - structure (optional; can be covered by integration tests)
- [ ] unit tests - cases (optional; integration tests probably cover enough)
- ~~[ ] deployable into docker container(s)~~
- ~~[ ] database in docker container~~
- ~~[ ] api in docker container~~
- ~~[ ] client in docker container~~
